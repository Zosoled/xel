          <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p>This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to all visitors and users of the xel-toolkit.org
          website ("Website"), which is offered by Jarosław Foksa and/or any of his affiliates ("Xel Toolkit", "we",
          "us").</p>

          <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using any part of the Website, you
          acknowledge you have been informed of and consent to our practices with regard to your personal
          information and data.</p>

          <h3>What information Xel Toolkit collects and why</h3>

          <section>
            <h4>Information from Website visitors</h4>

            <p>Like most web operators, Xel Toolkit collects basic non-personally-identifying information from
            Website visitors of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
            browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We
            collect this information to better understand how visitors use the Website, to improve our Website
            and experience for visitors, and to monitor security of the Website.</p>

            <p>Xel Toolkit also collects potentially personally-identifying information like IP addresses from
            visitors. Xel Toolkit does not use such information to identify or track individual visitors,
            however. We collect this information to understand how visitors use the Website, to improve
            performance and content, and to monitor security of the Website.</p>

            <p>Xel Toolkit may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our Website. For instance,
            Xel Toolkit may reveal how many views a particular file got using aggregated statistics that contain
            anonymous user information only.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Personally-identifying information</h4>

            <p>Users of the Website may choose to interact with Xel Toolkit in ways that provide us with their
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Xel Toolkit gathers
            depends on the nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to
            share. For example, we ask visitors who want to publish content on the Website to provide a username
            and email address to identify them.</p>

            <p>We will also collect the information you provide us in connection with creating an account on the
            Website. Basic profile information is shared publicly, as well as activity under your profile and the
            date your profile was created. If you report a security vulnerability to Xel Toolkit and request
            public acknowledgement, then we may publicly disclose the personal information you provided to us in
            connection with the report, including your name to fulfill your request for acknowledgement. In each
            case, Xel Toolkit collects such personally-identifiable information only insofar as is necessary or
            appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with or request of Xel Toolkit. We will
            not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it
            may prevent you from engaging in certain Website-related activities or being able to access and use
            certain features and services.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Information Xel Toolkit does not collect</h4>

            <p>Xel Toolkit does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security
            numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Xel Toolkit does not
            request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that users might
            store this kind of information in a Xel Toolkit cloud storage. If you store any sensitive personal
            information on Xel Toolkit’s servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our
            servers, which are located in the United States.</p>

            <p>If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account an Website account. Xel Toolkit
            does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our Website or content specifically to
            children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will
            close the child’s account.</p> </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Basis for processing your information</h4>

            <p><strong>Performance of a contract</strong>. The use of your information may be necessary to
            perform the contract that you have with us. For example, if you use our Website to purchase Xel
            Toolkit subscriptions, report bugs, report feature requests, create a profile, post and comment
            through our Website, or request information through our Website, we will use your information to
            carry out our obligation to complete and administer that contract or request.</p>

            <p><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>. We use your information for our legitimate interests, such
            as to provide you with the best content through our Website and communications with users and the
            public, to improve and promote our products and services, and for administrative, security, fraud
            prevention and legal purposes.</p>

            <p><strong>Consent</strong>. We may rely on your consent to use your personal information for certain
            direct marketing purposes, such as sending you newsletter updates about Xel Toolkit. You may withdraw
            your consent at any time through the unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email or by

          <h3>How Xel Toolkit uses and protects personally-identifying information</h3>

          <section>
            <h4>Sharing your information</h4>

            <p>Xel Toolkit only discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to
            know that information in order to process it on Xel Toolkit's behalf or to provide services available
            on the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p>

            <p>Xel Toolkit will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as
            described above, Xel Toolkit discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
            reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Xel Toolkit, third parties, or the public at
            large.</p>

            <p>Xel Toolkit takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
            alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information.</p> </section>

          <section>
            <h4>International transfer of information</h4>

            <p>The Website is hosted in the United States and information we collect will be stored and processed
            on our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that
            process information for us as described above may be located in the United States or in other
            countries outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the international
            transfer of your information by Xel Toolkit.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Xel Toolkit communications with you</h4>

            <p>If you are a registered user of the Website and have supplied your email address, Xel Toolkit may
            occasionally send you an email to tell you about security, system information, new features, solicit
            your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Xel Toolkit and our products. We
            primarily use our Website to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
            email to a minimum. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails
            we send you so you can stop receiving such emails at any time.</p>

            <p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
            we reserve the right to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
            or to help us support other users. We will not publish your personally-identifiable information in
            connection with your request.</p>

          <h3>Cookies, tracking technologies and "Do not track"</h3>

          <section>
            <h4>Cookies</h4>

            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
            visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Xel Toolkit uses cookies to
            help Xel Toolkit identify and track visitors, their usage of the Website, and their Website access
            preferences. Xel Toolkit visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers may set
            their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Website. Disabling browser cookies may cause
            certain features of Xel's Website to not function properly.</p>

            <p>Certain pages on the Website may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content,
            such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. These sites set their own cookies and we do not
            have access or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our
            Privacy Policy.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Tracking technologies</h4>

            <p>We use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these services to track you individually or
            collect your personally identifiable-information. We use these services to collect information about
            how the Website performs and how users navigate through and use the Website so we can monitor and
            improve our content and Website performance.</p>

            <p>Third party tracking services gather certain simple, non-personally identifying information over
            time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages,
            timestamp, and similar data about your use of the Website. We do not link this information to any of
            your personal information such as your user name.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>"Do not track"</h4>

            <p>"Do not track" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online
            services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third
            party tracking services. Xel Toolkit does not track your online browsing activity on other online
            services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site
            beyond our basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not share this kind of data with
            third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection for any of our users, and we
            do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an
            individual browser's "Do not track" setting.</p>

          <h3>Data retention and deletion</h3>

          <p>If you already have an account on xel-toolkit.org, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic
          user profile information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.</p>

          <p>Xel Toolkit will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to

          was collected and processed.</p>

          <p>Please note that due to public nature of some of our services, we may retain limited
          personally-identifiable information indefinitely. For example, if you provide your information in
          connection with a bug report or a comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted
          your account as we do not automatically delete community posts.</p>
